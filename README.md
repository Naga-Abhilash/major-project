Smart crop customizable cultivating bot

The world’s population is growing and with that growth we must produce more food. Due to the industrial and petrochemical revolutions, the agriculture industry has kept up in food production, but only by compromising the soil, the environment, our health, and the food production system itself. The increased production has largely come from incremental changes in technology and economies of scale, but that trend is reaching a plateau. Conventional agriculture methods are unsustainable and a paradigm shift is needed.

Crop customizable Farmbot is scalable automated precision farming machine and software package designed from the ground up with today’s technologies. Similar to today’s CNC milling machines, FarmBot hardware employs linear guides in the X, Y, and Z directions that allow for tooling such as plows, seed injectors, watering nozzles, and sensors, to be precisely positioned and used on the plants and soil. The entire system is numerically controlled and thus fully automated from the sowing of seeds to harvest. The hardware is designed to be simple, scalable, and hackable. Using the android app and cloud-based technology developed, the control and access of the information about the system can be done from anywhere.
